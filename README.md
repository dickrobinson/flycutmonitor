flycutmonitor
==========

Shell script and launchd plist to save your pasteboard whenever Flycut saves a new clipboard


## ! NOTE !

You ***must*** edit the file `com.tjluoma.flycutmonitor.plist` before using it!

Change the line:

  	<string>/Users/luomat/Library/Application Support/Flycut/com.generalarcade.flycut.plist</string>

Specifically, change `luomat` to whatever your username is on your local Mac.

**Otherwise this will not work!**
